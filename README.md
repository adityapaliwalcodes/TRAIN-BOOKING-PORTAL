## 📝 Project Description
I have created a train bookin portal , which serves the need of booking ticket online rather than waiting in long queue near trainticket counter , I have used HTML , CSS and JS for making this website.
It has some demo train filled in it showing time , fare and juction it is connecting , the train are very limited and for now restricted to only terminal junction of the route.
The user can book the ticket and check its PNR status within the website.
User must log in to access the features of the website.
